## Intro / Goals

This is a small, simple example Cycle application. Its purpose is simply to
contain a variety of common application feature ideas, demonstrating how various
Cycle mechanisms work.

## Why?

Much of our mainstream customer work and training (I have trained many many
developers) involves Angular or React. These are both popular for numerous good
reasons. But there are things to be learned by picking up less popular tooling,
and Cycle seems to be a particularly interesting edge case: what if we mostly
just had observables and virtual DOM? Is that enough? It seems to mostly be
enough.

## This component

Look at the source code for this "home" component. It is the simplest type of
component, it consumes no sources and produces only one sink.
